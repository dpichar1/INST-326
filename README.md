# INST-326

Our project repository for our digital wallet project. This project will be made using python, which would designed to securely manage and track financial transactions. This digital wallet will allow users to create accounts, store a virtual balance, and perform simulated deposits, withdrawals, and transactions between users. Furthermore, there will be an authentcation system, using hashes and encryption to handle sensitive data. We are still planning out whether our project will use a GUI or CLI for user interaction.
